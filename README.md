## Overview
This is an extension of [GameFormer](https://github.com/MCZhi/GameFormer), focusing on a comprehensive planning framework for autonomous driving. The framework consists of four key steps: feature processing, path planning, model query, and trajectory refinement. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed planning framework, validating its effectiveness in both open-loop and closed-loop tests.

## Getting started
### 1. Installation
To begin, please follow these steps:
- Download the [nuPlan dataset](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuplan#download) and set it up as described [here](https://nuplan-devkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset_setup.html).
- Install the nuPlan devkit [here](https://nuplan-devkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) (version tested: v1.2.2).
- Clone this repository and navigate into the folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/MCZhi/GameFormer-Planner.git && cd GameFormer-Planner
```
- Activate the environment created when installing the nuPlan-devkit:
```
conda activate nuplan
```
- Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Add the following environment variable to your `~/.bashrc` (you can customize it):
```
export NUPLAN_EXP_ROOT="$HOME/nuplan/exp"
```

### 2. Data process
Before training the GameFormer model, you need to preprocess the raw data using:
```
python data_process.py \
--data_path nuplan/dataset/nuplan-v1.1/splits/mini \
--map_path nuplan/dataset/maps \
--save_path nuplan/processed_data
```
Three arguments are necessary: ```--data_path``` to specify the path to the stored nuPlan dataset, ```--map_path``` to specify the path to the nuPlan map data, and ```--save_path``` to specify the path to save the processed data.

Optional arguments like ```--scenarios_per_type``` and ```--total_scenarios``` can also be used to specify the amount of data to process.

### 3. Training
To train the GameFormer model, run:
```
python train_predictor.py \
--train_set nuplan/processed_data/train \
--valid_set nuplan/processed_data/valid
```
Two arguments are necessary: ```--train_set``` to specify the path to the processed training data and ```--valid_set``` to specify the path to the processed validation data.

Optional model arguments: ```--encoder_layers``` for the number of encoding layers, ```--decoder_layers``` for the number of interaction decoding layers, and ```--num_neighbors``` for the number of neighboring agents to predict (max number is 20).

Optional training parameters:```--train_epochs```, ```--batch_size```, and ```--learning_rate```.

### 4. Testing
To test the planning framework in nuPlan simulation scenarios, use:
```
python run_nuplan_test.py \
--experiment_name open_loop_boxes \
--data_path nuplan/dataset/nuplan-v1.1/splits/mini \
--map_path nuplan/dataset/maps \
--model_path training_log/your/model
```
Choose one of the three options ('open_loop_boxes', 'closed_loop_nonreactive_agents', 'closed_loop_reactive_agents') for ```--experiment_name```, and specify the ```--model_path```, which points to your trained model. Ensure to provide ```--data_path``` and ```--map_path``` arguments as done in the data process step.

Adjust the ```--scenarios_per_type``` and ```--total_scenarios``` arguments to control the number of scenarios tested.

**Make sure the model parameters in ```planner.py``` in ```_initialize_model``` match those used in training.**
